# SMART-on-FHIR
A SMART on a FHIR app (also application, service) runs against a SMART on a FHIR system,
extending its functionality as electronic health record (EHR) system or data warehouse that 
supports the FHIR standard, patients, doctors, and healthcare practitioners. 
OAuth2 and OpenID are a Web standard for authorization.
